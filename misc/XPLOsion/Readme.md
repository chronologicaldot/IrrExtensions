XPLOsion is a GUI layout loader that reads an XML and CSS files as if it were like HTML and CSS for websites. The node names and attributes are the same as the serializable names and attributes of the Irrlicht GUI elements.

Unfortunately, this loader only works for Irrlicht 1.7.3. There are too many changes that need to be made to fix it. Besides, [CupricBridge](https://github.com/chronologicaldot/CupricBridge ) is faster and easier.
