# Irrlicht Extensions

This is a curated list of extensions for the [Irrlicht engine](http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net). All of this is free code subject to zlib style license unless otherwise specified. Everything in here should work with the latest version of Irrlicht (currently 1.9 unpublished developer version).

Exceptions:
- CGUIGroupingPanel requires vector2d<T>::move(T,T) (which simply adds the argument values to the X and Y members respectively). This element could also be used with subversion revision 5104 if certain updateImageCache lines are uncommented and others commented out.
