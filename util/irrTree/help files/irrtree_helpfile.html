	<p>
		This is a class designed for storing data in a DOM tree format.
		Think of it like a multidimensional array whose size is dynamic.
		It utilizes irrlicht's native array class to store the children of a node, and the accessing
		of such children and storing data to them is similar. The difference is that, instead of
		storing in the tree any random data type, we store irrTreeElements - a class that is to
		be inherited from and whose functions are required for searching the tree normally.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that, because it utilizes irrlicht's built-in array class, irrTree is not a standalone
		class.

		None known at this time. However, it might seem annoying at times if your syntax
		when adding nodes is not correct.
